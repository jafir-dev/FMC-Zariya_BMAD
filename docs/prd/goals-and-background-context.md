# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

* Launch a scalable SaaS product with a tiered pricing model to capture the UAE's Facility Management Company (FMC) market.
* Significantly reduce the average ticket resolution time and operational overhead for FMCs.
* Achieve high user adoption and satisfaction across all seven user roles, measured by post-job ratings and active use.
* Improve the first-time-fix rate for technicians through clear information and streamlined workflows.
* Decrease the volume of tenant follow-up inquiries by providing full transparency on ticket status.

## Background Context

Facility Management Companies currently suffer from inefficient, manual, and non-transparent processes for handling maintenance requests. This fragmentation leads to operational delays, poor communication between tenants and staff, and a lack of data-driven insights, ultimately causing tenant dissatisfaction and higher costs.

Zariya FMC solves this by providing a unified, role-based Progressive Web App (PWA) that digitizes and automates the entire maintenance lifecycle. The platform streamlines everything from ticket creation and inspection to approvals, procurement, and final, OTP-verified job completion. This creates a transparent, efficient, and communicative ecosystem for tenants, FMC staff, and associated vendors.
