# Technical Assumptions

## Repository Structure: Monorepo

A **monorepo** structure is recommended. This will allow us to manage both the frontend PWA and the backend API in a single repository, making it easier to share code (like data types) and manage dependencies.

## Service Architecture: Serverless

A **Serverless** architecture (e.g., using Vercel Functions, AWS Lambda) is suggested. This model is cost-effective to start, scales automatically with demand, and pairs perfectly with a modern PWA, aligning with our goal of a scalable SaaS platform.

## Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration

A testing strategy that includes both **Unit Tests** for individual functions and components, and **Integration Tests** to ensure the different parts of the application work correctly together will be established.

## Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

The recommended technology stack is **Next.js with TypeScript for the frontend and backend, styled with Tailwind CSS, and connected to a PostgreSQL database via Prisma**.
