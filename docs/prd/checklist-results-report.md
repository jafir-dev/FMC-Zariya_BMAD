# Checklist Results Report

I have validated the PRD against the BMad PM Master Checklist. The document is in excellent shape and ready for the next phase.

### Category Statuses

| Category | Status | Critical Issues |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1. Problem Definition & Context | ✅ PASS | None |
| 2. MVP Scope Definition | ✅ PASS | None |
| 3. User Experience Requirements | ✅ PASS | None |
| 4. Functional Requirements | ✅ PASS | None |
| 5. Non-Functional Requirements | ✅ PASS | None |
| 6. Epic & Story Structure | ✅ PASS | None |
| 7. Technical Guidance | ✅ PASS | None |
| 8. Cross-Functional Requirements | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Data migration and specific operational needs can be further detailed during the architecture phase. |
| 9. Clarity & Communication | ✅ PASS | None |

### Critical Deficiencies
* None. The PRD is not blocked.

### Recommendations
* The Architect should explicitly define data seeding strategies and detailed monitoring requirements for key workflows during the architecture design phase to address the `PARTIAL` status in section 8.

### Final Decision
* **READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design.
