# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The core UX vision for Zariya FMC is **effortless efficiency**. The interface should be intuitive enough for a first-time tenant to submit a ticket without any training, yet powerful enough for a supervisor to manage dozens of tasks daily. The design will be clean, uncluttered, and focused, prioritizing clarity and ease of use to reduce cognitive load on all users.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

* **Task-Driven Dashboards:** Each user role will have a dedicated dashboard that surfaces the most critical information and immediate tasks relevant to them.
* **Guided Workflows:** Submitting tickets, approving quotes, and completing jobs will follow a step-by-step, wizard-like process to ensure all necessary information is captured correctly.
* **Real-time Feedback:** The UI will provide immediate feedback for user actions, such as submitting a form or updating a ticket's status.

## Core Screens and Views

* **Login/Authentication Screen:** A simple and secure entry point.
* **Customer Dashboard:** View and manage properties, see a list of active/past tickets, and create new requests.
* **Ticket Submission Form:** A multi-step form for capturing all ticket details.
* **Supervisor Dashboard:** An overview of all building tickets, staff assignments, and pending approvals.
* **Technician/Vendor Task View:** A simple list or card view of assigned jobs with all necessary details.
* **Ticket Detail View:** A comprehensive view of a single ticket's history, communication, media, and status, tailored to the viewing user's role.

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The application will be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards. This includes considerations for screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, and support for both English and Arabic (Right-to-Left layout).

## Branding

The platform will be designed to be "white-labeled." Each FMC client will be able to upload their own logo and input their company details, which will automatically appear on customer-facing views and downloadable documents like receipts.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

The application will be a Progressive Web App (PWA), built with a mobile-first, responsive design to ensure a seamless experience on any device, from a tenant's mobile phone to a supervisor's desktop computer.
