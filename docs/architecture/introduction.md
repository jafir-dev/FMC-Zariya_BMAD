# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Zariya FMC, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack. This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

The project will be bootstrapped using the **"T3 Stack"** starter template. This aligns perfectly with the PRD's technical assumptions (Monorepo, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Serverless) and provides a best-practices foundation, significantly accelerating initial setup and development.
